21-10-2022,5,My family & I recently stayed in ITC Maratha for 3 nights this month. We had booked an Executive suite but were upgraded to a Deluxe Suite as the key cards/lights weren't working during check in.  The room was spotlessly clean but the general upkeep of the rooms could be better. The hotel could do well with a kids' zone even a small one. ,Indrani D,3 nights family stay,221021

06-10-2022,5,Stayed at ITC Maratha for a couple of days with my family for a leisure vacation at Mumbai. Had requested for adjacent rooms for my kids that was taken care of. On checkin I was upgraded to the pool view rooms. The service and the food were exceptionally good. The  food was deliciously tasty and special thanks to the whole culinary team at the Peshwa Pavilion.  Chef Sridhar Patra and Chef Pravin Patil were great hosts at the breakfast table we enjoyed some cooking tips exchange and they also took special care of my young son who loves food.  Thank you so much for making our stay so wonderful. The dinner buffet spread was also very lavish and the decor of Peshwa Pavilion is just too nice.

20-08-2022,5,Stayed two nights at the hotel.  Great room and general decor around the hotel.  Very efficient staff.  At the reception Ayesha Jasleen and Urvsashi were quick professional and friendly both at time of check in and check out; ensured that we got the best room available and during the stay constantly inquired with us that we were comfortable.  The Pavilion restaurant is outstanding.  The breakfast buffet spread is one of the best. The staff here have been highly trained; mention must be made of the senior people here: Derrick and Hitesh and the chefs Pravin Vinayak and Sreedhar.  The buffet lunch is not to be missed.  In particular the Rogan Josh the mutton biryani and the Saag ghost are out of this world. Highly highly recommended. While one ejoys the decilacies always available is the superb service by the staff there; cannot list all but some whose names I recollect are Hariprasad Amin and Riva.,mathurpradeep017,Superb lunch buffet,220820

04-07-2022,5,I stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights in July 2022. At first I was a little apprehensive about the service I would receive.

Great people that run this hotel,220704
01-07-2022,5,I stayed in this hotel for 3 days in June. The experience was fantastic. Very polite well mannered staff. Namely Maxime (Concierge) and Lalit and Ketan (bell desk). They greeted me every time with a smile and a namaste. Maxime helped me with everything- from calling in favors to help me shop for my family abroad to getting me in touch with a good courier company that came to the hotel to pick up my parcel. He was quick to respond to all my questions and that helped tremendously. Lalit and Ketan helped me with my bags booking my cabs to go into the city and also helped get me some medicines I needed on the day of my check out. They went of their way to help make my stay comfortable. Will be returning to this hotel for my future stays because of these people that know what real customer service should look like.,316kasturik,Luxury hotel very close to Mumbai international airport,220701

06-05-2022,3,I had high expectations as it is an ITC hotel in a place like Mumbai. But starting from check-in which was incredibly slow I was quite disappointed with the overall ambience.

We ordered room service and the food was excellent - they made rice and lentils for our kids with no spice on special request. I want to mention 2 people at the breakfast as well who really went way and beyond to help me imran chaudhry and Angad yadav. I only stayed for one night but I wish it was a longer stay. On our way out I met the front office manager Aadhaar Sharma who came and checked if our stay was comfortable.

Kapil Dubey is the most helpful manager you can find here. One more reason for choosing this place is the food. Food is beyond awesome. Restaurants are never empty here and buffets are full of delicacies. Rooms feel cozy not like some typical hotel room and that's why you can stay here for long durations without getting that hotel room sickness. Staff is quick when you need them for anything. Gardens are beautiful to roam around and it's near the airport so very convenient.,kanikamishra3,Best place to stay in Mumbai,220207

01-01-2022,3,Just wanted to caution the visitors about the different rooms the hotel offers. I had booked an executive room with a pool/garden view and was disappointed with the allocation especially as I had paid an extra amount for the view. None of the sites ITC Mariott Bonvoy app MMT etc provides a clear picture of the room and the view they have to offer. Overall a good hotel (4 out 5) but I'm personally disappointed about being tricked into a room with a boring view.,joygpinto,Disappointed with the view,220101

26-12-2021,5,Thanks to covid this was first time in a long time that my parents were not going to be around the kids. Being based in NZ coming from the same industry I knew a night stay will be perfect. The team at ITC went all out right from check-in spa treatments lunch dinner and breakfast- nothing went wrong. It's incredible to see how small little things go a long way to making up the experience. Noella as lovely as always went over and above to helping me and coordinating everything over the phone and managing with time difference. My parents kept mentioning about another amazing lady (I'm sorry I don't remember the name) who checked on them throughout their stay without fail.,Renunitin,Incredible,211226
22-12-2021,5,I finished a 2 day pleasure trip to Mumbai and chose to stay at this hotel. From the check in formalities to check out my experience was nothing short of excellent. While the hotel itself is a beautiful one well maintained and very presentable what stood out was the service. It was attentive and polite an absolute delight. Things were done quietly and efficiently and most of all without getting in the way. There was a wedding organized in the hotel during my stay and most of the guests were from that party but I did not feel for a single moment that I was not accorded the attention I needed. The restaurants the spa the bar all were a delight to be in. The food was excellent at both the Peshwa Pavilion and at Peshawari. This is truly a 5 star hotel and its service defines it. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.,PrashantC353,Service Excellence,211222

I immediately reached out to Mr Mattoo GM Jaipur. He reached out to mumbai and they took charge.  Abhay ( front office) arranged for my husband to go to the hospital. Maxim accompanied him and was with him till i reached around midnight. Abhay was constantly updating me about the progress and arranged a car to pick me from the airport. The driver Shetty was empathetic and since he had taken my husband to the hospital kept reassuring me that he was fine. What a fine set of people. What a commendable service standards. Thank you all.

27-11-2021,5,Two names stand out at this property. Rashpal Padam - an extremely charming and adorable front desk manager who was very helpful in my entire stay. Upendar Tomar - F&B manager took meticulous care of micro managing my dietary requirements and ensuring the most exceptional food was catered to me at all times. All of this is only possible when you have a tremendously over zealous GM and ZUBIN SONGADWALA is a GM who truly rules the roost.

But the service is too too slow. We had to wait for half and hour or may be more to get a dental kit after calling housekeeping for at least 4 to 5 times. Even the buffet breakfast had super slow service. Had to remind multiple times to get one thing. Either is staff was scarce or if not they was inefficient or ignorant.

18-09-2021,1,Yes its a luxury hotel. However the luxury is limited to the staff and not the customers. Be prepared to wait for everything that you order. Be it food or your car. I have order tea which turned out to be cold several times. You have to ask for toiletries and essential things. The breakfast spread is limited to at the most 10 items. I have been staying in the hotel for 3 days and it's a biggest mistake. Thank you and no more. I suggest not to waste you time and book an oyo instead.,PeeKayyy,Disappointed,210918

Despite being a Gold member of Marriott Envoy and also despite my repeated request they did not upgrade us to a suite. Vacant suites were available. They kept on promising that they will revert as and when a suit is available but once you check-in they completely forget. Also they don't give a damn to Marriott membership.,DineshBhasin,A very good property near International Airport.,210827

Chef Nikhil specially made the most delicious  poha after I told him that I was languishing  for a hot Indian breakfast. The paneer kathi roll later that afternoon was the best I had ever tasted. Edwin Debnath from F&B was ever attentive and just a shout away. The ITC One pool-facing room was beautiful and spacious with a sprawling dress area and a gorgeous bathroom.

The architecture of the interior is astoundingly beautiful. We loved that rooms provide complimentary filtered water in glass bottles to cut down on Indias ubiquitous plastic waste. We also loved Peshawri restaurant which provided some of the best (and most plentiful) food weve had in ages. The front desk concierge and bell staff was fantastic including Mr. Lalit and Ms. Rashi.

Its a very relaxing place to stay in the middle of a city which is running like mad all the time. I loved the architecture and interiors which give it a feel of the Maratha era. The Staff was very helpful right from checking in to the dining uptil i left. i was told that their coffee shop has been refurbished which i felt was very cozy and comfortable ( i think its because of the blue colored theme). The one useful feature i found was that their Sofas have a built in charger which often becomes necessary if i have to take calls and i can't leave the area. Loved the food and the selections of cuisines that they have there. the hotel manager Abhay became a guide for me to browse through the restaurants. His team made sure all my needs ( from getting a meeting room to local travel sorted) were taken care of. Will definitely come back here again!,370nikhilg,A very relaxing stay!,200107
